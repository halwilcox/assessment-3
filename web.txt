    The purpose of the web is to move data from one place to another. The client, such as a computer connected to Wi-Fi,
communicate with servers. Servers are computers that store webpages, sites, or apps. When the client sends a request 
for a website through a URL, the server will respond and download a copy of the requested webpage onto the clients 
machine to be displayed in the user's web browser. 
    To break it down even further, we typically talk to servers by using their hostname such as amazon.com. The request is 
    then send to the local DNS Cache and then your cable modem. It then travels to the DNS server and located the address 
    of the server that website lives on. Your browser sends an HTTP request message. If the server approves the 
    clients request, the website responds and starts sending website files in data packets. After recieving the packets,
    your browser will assemble all the small chunks into a complete webpage.
